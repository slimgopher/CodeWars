Refactored Greeting

The following code could use a bit of object-oriented artistry.
While it's a simple method and works just fine as it is,
in a larger system it's best to organize methods into classes/objects.
(Or, at least, something similar depending on your language)

Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each
Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be
instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed
into each greet method call

def greet(my_name, your_name):
    return "Hello %s, my name is %s" % (your_name, my_name)
